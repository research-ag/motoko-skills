# Mops Package Maintenance

## What This Is

A step-by-step playbook for an AI agent to fully maintain a Motoko package
published on [MOPS](https://mops.one): upgrade dependencies, validate the
package, polish docs, format the code, ensure CI, and prepare a versioned
release branch — all in one automated pass.

## When to Use

- Periodic dependency-bump maintenance runs.
- Before cutting a new release.
- When the user asks to "update deps", "maintain the package", or
  "prepare a release".

## Key Conventions (apply throughout)

These rules are referenced from individual steps. Read them once.

- **`pocket-ic` is the only bench runtime — pin it like `moc`.** mops
  CLI v3.0.0 removed dfx-replica support entirely (the `--replica`
  flag on `mops test`/`mops bench` is gone too). If the package has
  benchmarks, replica tests, or uses `--check-deploy`, `[toolchain]
  pocket-ic` **must** be pinned or `mops bench` fails outright. Unlike
  the `files` field, this is not hands-off: if it's missing, add it
  with `mops toolchain use pocket-ic <version>` (mops's own error
  names a concrete version, e.g. `15.0.0`) the same way `[toolchain]
  moc` is actively managed. **Pin `15.0.0`, not `16.1.0`:** 16.1.0
  adds about 20,000 instructions to every bench call that writes to
  the heap (a single `Bool` field write: 241 → 20,237), which makes
  small cells meaningless.
- **Benchmarks should measure optimized Wasm — configure `[optimize]`
  and pin `wasm-opt`.** `mops bench` (and `mops build`) only run
  Binaryen's `wasm-opt` when an `[optimize]` section exists in
  `mops.toml` — even an empty `[optimize]` activates it, at the
  default `level = "O3"` / `keep-names = true`. **Without it, no
  optimization runs at all** and benchmark numbers reflect raw
  compiler output, not what actually ships in a production canister.
  Like `pocket-ic`, `[optimize]` requires an explicit `[toolchain]
  wasm-opt` pin or the build fails before compiling. **If the package
  has benchmarks and `[optimize]` is missing, add both** during
  maintenance (see Step 5) — don't leave this for the user to notice.
  Don't add `args = ["--all-features"]` to `[optimize]`: wasm-opt
  already reads the features moc declares in the module, and
  `--all-features` lets it emit features the IC rejects (GC,
  multi-memory, relaxed SIMD, …).
- **Commit `mops.lock`** — for libraries as well as applications. The
  mops docs (https://docs.mops.one/mops.lock) reversed the earlier
  advice to ignore it: the lockfile keeps your own CI reproducible and
  has no effect on consumers. Remove `mops.lock` from `.gitignore`,
  regenerate it once (delete it, run `mops install`), commit it
  together with the lockfile of every nested project (`examples/`
  etc.), and run CI with `--locked` (see the CI skill).
- **moc 2.0.0 specifics** (when moving `[toolchain] moc` to 2.x):
  - Legacy persistence and the copying/compacting/generational GCs are
    gone: drop `[moc] args = ["--legacy-persistence"]` and any
    `--copying-gc`.
  - Actors are persistent by default: moc 2 warns that `persistent` is
    redundant (M0217), but moc 1.x *requires* it (M0220). Tests and
    examples written for moc 2 therefore don't compile on 1.x — fine,
    since they run on the toolchain moc; only `src/` must satisfy
    `[requirements] moc`.
  - Dot notation on a function returning `async*` only resolves on
    moc 2. Applying the M0236 autofix to such calls raises
    `[requirements] moc` to `2.0.0` — decide explicitly, or keep the
    module-style call.
  - The M0236 autofix turns `x |> M.f(_)` into `x |> _.f()`. Rewrite
    that to `x.f()`; keep the pipe only where `_` is used twice.
- **Hands-off fields in `mops.toml`:** never auto-edit `[package] files`
  or auto-add entries to `[toolchain]`. Report and warn instead.
  **Exceptions: `[toolchain] pocket-ic` and `[optimize]` /
  `[toolchain] wasm-opt`** — see the two bullets above; add them when
  benchmarks require it, same as `moc`.
- **CHANGELOG only lists consumer-visible bumps:** `[dependencies]`
  and `[requirements]`. Never list `[toolchain]` or
  `[dev-dependencies]`.
- **Documentation gate:** if MOPS reports Documentation = 100% (Step 1),
  skip Steps 7 and 8 entirely. Otherwise aim for 100% — fill in every
  missing `///` doc string on a public declaration at minimum.
- **No `moc --check` in CI.** It's a local-only check the agent runs
  during maintenance; different CI compiler versions could cause
  spurious failures for consumers.
- **`mops add` rewrites `mops.toml`** and can silently reset
  `[requirements] moc` to `"1.0.0"`. Diff after every `mops add` and
  restore the intended value.

## Prerequisites

- `mops` CLI (`npm i -g ic-mops`)
- `moc` (Motoko compiler; pinned via `[toolchain] moc` in `mops.toml`
  and fetched with `mops toolchain bin moc` — as of mops CLI v3.0.0
  there's no dfx-bundled fallback, the pin is mandatory)
- `pocket-ic` (bench runtime; pinned via `[toolchain] pocket-ic` when
  the package has benchmarks — see Key Conventions)
- `wasm-opt` (Binaryen; only runs when `[optimize]` is set in
  `mops.toml`, and only then requires a `[toolchain] wasm-opt` pin —
  see Key Conventions)
- `dfx` (DFINITY SDK; optional — only needed for building canisters
  or examples, not for `mops bench`)
- `node` >= 22 / `npm`. Verify with `node --version`.
- `git`
- `prettier` and `prettier-plugin-motoko` — install **locally** before
  running prettier; `npx -y` alone does not auto-resolve the plugin in
  a clean checkout.

## Workflow

Work through every step in order. If a step fails, fix it before moving on.

### Step 0 — Create a maintenance branch

```bash
git checkout -b chore/dependency-bump-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

Also snapshot the untracked-file list now so you can tell scratch files
from your own additions in Step 11:

```bash
git status --short > /tmp/baseline.txt
```

### Step 1 — Verify Package Quality on MOPS

1. Open `mops.toml`. If it has no `[package]` section (only `[canister]`,
   or neither), it's not a published package — skip to Step 2.
2. Otherwise visit `https://mops.one/<package-name>` and review the
   **Package Quality** section (Documentation, License, Repository,
   Tests, Benchmarks).
   - `mops.one` is a SPA — `curl`/`WebFetch` see only an empty shell.
     If you can't render it, derive signals locally: run `mo-doc` and
     grep for `(no description)`; verify `[package] license` and
     `[package] repository` in `mops.toml`; confirm `mops test` and
     `mops bench` succeed. Ask the user to confirm anything you can't
     verify programmatically.
3. For any metric that isn't **"yes"** / **"100%"**:
   - **Documentation < 100%**: run the `motoko-doc-strings` skill in
     Steps 7–8. If already 100%, skip Steps 7–8.
   - **Missing License/Repository**: set them in `mops.toml` `[package]`.
   - **Tests/Benchmarks**: handled in Steps 4–5; ensure CI in Step 9c.
4. Raise a warning to the user for anything that can't be auto-fixed.

### Step 2 — Discover outdated dependencies

```bash
mops outdated
# Fallback: mops search <package-name>
```

Record packages needing upgrades.

**`moc` policy:** upgrade `[toolchain] moc` to the latest; set
`[requirements] moc` to the **absolute minimum** that still works
(determined iteratively in Step 3) — do not blindly align it with
the toolchain or with what dependencies declare.

### Step 3 — Upgrade dependencies in `mops.toml`

Update versions for every outdated entry in `[dependencies]` and
`[dev-dependencies]`.

**Determining `[requirements] moc`:**

1. **Initial version** — the max `moc` required by your regular
   `[dependencies]`, **excluding `core`**:
   1. List `[dependencies]` from your root `mops.toml` (skip `core`).
   2. For each, read `.mops/<name>@<version>/mops.toml` and extract
      `[requirements] moc` (skip if absent).
   3. Take the max. If lower than your current `[requirements] moc`,
      keep the current value instead.
2. **Check `core`** — after `mops install`, read
   `.mops/core@<version>/mops.toml` `[requirements] moc`.
3. **Iterative validation** (only if `core`'s requirement > initial):
   You MUST test EVERY intermediate `moc` version sequentially — do
   not skip (e.g., from 1.0.0 → 1.4.0; test 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0…).
   For each candidate `X`:
   1. Set `[toolchain] moc = "X"`.
   2. Run `mops test` (if tests exist).
   3. Run `mops bench` (if benchmarks exist).
   4. Build examples (Motoko canisters only — ignore asset/Rust):
      ```bash
      EXAMPLES_DIR=""
      if [ -d "examples" ]; then EXAMPLES_DIR="examples"
      elif [ -d "example" ]; then EXAMPLES_DIR="example"; fi
      if [ -n "$EXAMPLES_DIR" ]; then
        cd "$EXAMPLES_DIR"
        mops install
        if [ -f "icp.yaml" ] && command -v icp >/dev/null; then icp build --all
        elif [ -f "dfx.json" ]; then dfx build; fi
        cd ..
      fi
      ```
   5. If all pass, set `[requirements] moc = "X"` and stop.
   A faster check for the requirement itself: consumers only compile
   `src/`, so compile every `src/**/*.mo` with each candidate
   (`<mops cache>/moc/<X>/moc --check $(mops sources) <file>`). Tests,
   benches and examples only have to work with the toolchain moc.
4. **Failure:** if even `core`'s required version fails, revert
   `[requirements] moc` to the initial value and warn the user.
5. **Final sync:** restore `[toolchain] moc` to the latest version.

Then install:

```bash
mops install
```

Verify `mops install` succeeded without resolution errors and that
`mops.lock` updated. Never hand-edit the lock file.

#### Step 3a — Sync nested `mops.toml` files

Find every nested manifest (examples, sub-canisters, etc.):

```bash
find . -name mops.toml -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.mops/*"
```

For each nested `mops.toml`:

- Third-party `[dependencies]` versions should generally match the root
  (examples may add extras, but shared deps should align).
- `[toolchain] moc` must match the root and exist in the fork used by
  the CI `setup-mops` action.
- The package being maintained must reference itself by its **real
  package name** via a **relative local path**
  (e.g. `self-package-name = "../"`), with a comment showing the latest
  published version for easy manual swap by consumers.
- **Replace relative source imports** in example `.mo` files:
  `import "../../src/Main"` → `import "mo:self-package-name/Main"`.
  This ensures examples are copy-paste ready.

Example `examples/mops.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
core = "2.5.0"
self-package-name = "../"
# Replace with:
# self-package-name = "0.0.3"

[toolchain]
moc = "1.6.0"
```

#### Step 3b — Audit repo hygiene files

- **`.gitignore`** — create if missing; ensure it contains:
  ```text
  .mops/
  .icp/
  node_modules/
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  .dfx/
  build/
  skills-lock.json
  .agents
  ```
  Personal/editor files (`.idea`, `.vscode`, `.claude`, `.junie`,
  `.copilot`, `.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.DS_Store`) belong in the developer's
  global ignore, not here.
- **`mops.lock`** — commit it (see Key Conventions). If `.gitignore`
  contains `mops.lock`, delete that line.
- **`package-lock.json`** — if absent, don't introduce it.
- **`package.json`** — if present, ensure its `license` matches
  `mops.toml`. If absent, don't introduce it (and don't commit one
  that `npm` may create).
- **`mops.toml` `[package] files`** — hands off (see Key Conventions).
  Report its contents to the user and warn if something looks off
  (e.g., `examples/` exists but isn't listed). Only `.mo`, `.did`,
  `.md`, `.toml` are supported by `mops publish` — warn if other
  extensions appear.

#### Step 3c — Fix compiler warnings

Run the `fix-compiler-warnings` skill. Only act on warnings/errors
the compiler actually emits — do not invent "improvements".

Capture warnings for **Motoko canisters only** (ignore asset/Rust):

```bash
# DFX projects:
dfx build --check 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dfx_build_output.txt

# MOPS packages:
find src -type f -name "*.mo" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 $(mops toolchain bin moc) --check $(mops sources) 2>&1 | tee /tmp/moc_check_output.txt

# ICP-CLI projects:
icp build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/icp_build_output.txt
```

Fix one warning class at a time, re-run the check, and run
`mops test` / `mops bench` if relevant to catch regressions.

### Step 4 — Run tests

```bash
mops test
```

If tests fail, identify whether an upgraded dependency changed its
API, adapt the source, and re-run. Note any non-trivial changes
(renames, signature changes) for the CHANGELOG.

### Step 5 — Run benchmarks

If the package has benchmarks (a `bench/` directory with
`*.bench.mo` files), **before** running `mops bench`, make sure the
bench toolchain is fully configured. mops CLI v3.0.0 requires both of
the following to be pinned explicitly, or `mops bench` fails outright
(see Key Conventions):

1. **`[toolchain] pocket-ic`** — if missing, add it:
   ```bash
   mops toolchain use pocket-ic <version>   # mops's own error names one, e.g. 15.0.0
   ```
2. **`[optimize]` + `[toolchain] wasm-opt`** — if `[optimize]` is
   missing from `mops.toml`, **add it now**, don't just flag it. An
   empty section is enough (defaults to `level = "O3"`,
   `keep-names = true`):
   ```toml
   [optimize]

   [toolchain]
   wasm-opt = "<version>"
   ```
   Pin the version the same way as `pocket-ic`:
   ```bash
   mops toolchain use wasm-opt <version>   # or: mops toolchain info wasm-opt
   ```
   Without `[optimize]`, `mops bench` silently measures unoptimized
   Wasm — not what the CHANGELOG's benchmark numbers should represent.
   If you add `[optimize]` to a package that didn't have it before,
   say so in the CHANGELOG (Step 6): the resulting shift in bench
   numbers is a measurement-methodology change, not a code
   regression/improvement.

Then run:

```bash
mops install   # picks up any new [toolchain] pins
mops bench
```

Apply Step 4-style fixes for compile/run failures.

**Environmental failures vs code failures.** If `mops bench` errors
**after** the `Deploying canisters...` line — typically:

- `TrustError: Certificate verification error: "Invalid signature"`
- `UND_ERR_SOCKET` / `fetch failed`
- `Could not find the PocketIC binary`

— benchmarks compiled fine; this is a `pocket-ic`/`mops` agent
compatibility issue, not your bump. In order: kill stale `pocket-ic`
processes; confirm `[toolchain] pocket-ic` is pinned and re-fetch the
binary (`mops toolchain bin pocket-ic`), re-pinning to a newer
version with `mops toolchain use pocket-ic <version>` if it looks
stale or missing (see Key Conventions — there is no dfx-replica
fallback to drop back to as of mops CLI v3.0.0); as a last resort,
drop the `bench` job from CI and flag the user. Don't burn the
release chasing this.

Significant regressions: note for the CHANGELOG but don't block the
release unless the user asks.

**Reading the numbers under moc 2.0.0** (enhanced orthogonal
persistence, incremental GC — the only combination left):

- **Heap** is the cell's allocation (temporaries and retained memory
  combined). With mops CLI ≤ 3.4.2 it also contains a constant
  ~35.5 KiB of harness overhead in every cell (caffeinelabs/mops#876;
  fixed by #878): subtract the no-op row. After the fix, 0 B means
  allocation-free.
- **Garbage Collection** is always 0: the incremental GC never collects
  inside a measured call. Neither `__motoko_gc_trigger` (it respects
  the threshold) nor allocating ballast changes that. With #878 the
  all-zero table is no longer printed.
- **Instructions** of a no-op cell are ~70 with mops ≤ 3.4.2 (field
  lookup of the cell function plus the call), ~34 with #878. A table of
  routines (`routines[ri][ci]()`) adds ~85 more for the 2-D lookup and
  the inner call; the "no-op function" column is the baseline to
  subtract.
- Numbers measured before moc 2 (legacy persistence, copying GC,
  32-bit) aren't comparable: object sizes double on the 64-bit heap,
  and the incremental GC's write barrier adds ~10% to pointer-heavy
  code.

### Step 6 — Update the CHANGELOG

Open or create `CHANGELOG.md` and add a section at the top for the
upcoming version (number finalized in Step 10).

Include (only `[dependencies]` and `[requirements]` — see Key
Conventions):

- **Dependencies bumped** — list each upgraded `[dependencies]` entry,
  old → new.
- **Breaking / notable changes** — source-code adaptations.
- **Bug fixes** — anything found and fixed during the run.

If no CHANGELOG exists, create one:

```markdown
# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Updated `core` from `2.0.0` to `2.5.0`.
- Bumped `bench` from `1.0.0` to `2.0.1`.
- Updated `[requirements] moc` from `1.2.0` to `1.3.0` (only if changed).

### Fixed

- Adapted `<function>` to new `<dep>` API (renamed `old` → `new`).
```

Newest version on top. Match an existing CHANGELOG style if present.

**Never rename or merge the section of a version that is already
published.** Compare the headings with `mops info <package>` (its
`versions` line); if a published version has no section, restore it
from git history. Anything removed or changed incompatibly since the
last *published* version — including functions that a published
version added and the new one drops — goes into the new section as
**Breaking**.

### Step 7 — Review and improve doc strings

Skip if MOPS Documentation = 100% (see Key Conventions). Otherwise
aim for 100%.

Scan every `.mo` file under `src/` for public declarations
(`type`, `func`, `actor`, `actor class`, `let`, `module`). For each:

1. Ensure a `///` doc string exists directly above.
2. From a first-time user's perspective: is the purpose clear? Are
   argument types/units/constraints documented? Trap/error behavior?
   Examples for non-trivial functions?
3. Improve or add as needed.

If the `motoko-doc-strings` skill is installed, follow its checklist.

### Step 8 — Review README and other Markdown

**Always check the links**, even at 100% documentation: mops.one
rewrites a relative link such as `examples/Main.mo` to
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repo>/master/examples/Main.mo`
— raw text instead of a rendered page, and a link to a directory
404s. Use absolute GitHub links that work on both sites:
`https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/main/<file>` and
`…/tree/main/<dir>`. `bench/`, `test/`, `*.bench.mo` and `*.test.mo`
are never uploaded (`mops publish` always excludes them, whatever
`[package] files` says), so link them on GitHub if the README refers
to them. Don't add notes like "renders properly on GitHub" — open the
package's page on mops.one (Readme, Docs, Versions) and fix what
doesn't render instead.

Skip the rest of this step if MOPS Documentation = 100%.

For `README.md` and every other `.md`:

1. Check factual accuracy (versions, API names, examples).
2. Fix outdated information; improve clarity, grammar, completeness.
3. Add sections for new API surface from upgraded deps.
4. Ensure `README.md` documents the formatter command, as a code block
   (add a "Development" or "Formatting" section if missing):
   ```bash
   npm install --no-save prettier prettier-plugin-motoko
   npx prettier --plugin prettier-plugin-motoko --write '**/*.{mo,json,md}'
   ```
   Don't document `npx -y prettier --plugin prettier-plugin-motoko …`:
   it fails in a clean checkout with `Cannot find package
   'prettier-plugin-motoko'`, because Prettier resolves the plugin from
   the project's `node_modules`, not from npx's cache (`npx -p …` fails
   the same way).

### Step 9 — Formatting

#### 9a — Prettier configuration

If `.prettierrc` is missing, or exists but is trivial (e.g. only
`tabWidth`), write:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-motoko"],
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "semi": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "useTabs": false
}
```

#### 9b — Format the code

`prettier`'s `--plugin` flag does not auto-resolve packages. Install
the plugin locally first (a bare `npx -y prettier --plugin
prettier-plugin-motoko ...` fails with `Cannot find package
'prettier-plugin-motoko'` in a clean checkout):

```bash
npm install --no-save prettier prettier-plugin-motoko
npx prettier --plugin prettier-plugin-motoko --write '**/*.{mo,json,md}'
```

#### 9c — Verify or add CI workflow

If the `motoko-github-ci-workflow` skill is installed, follow its
instructions instead of this section.

Otherwise create/update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with tests +
formatting. If the package has **benchmarks**, `[toolchain]
pocket-ic` must be pinned (per Key Conventions) and installed in CI
with `mops toolchain bin pocket-ic` before `mops bench` — PocketIC is
the only bench runtime as of mops CLI v3.0.0. `mops bench` starts and
stops its own PocketIC instance — never add a manual `dfx start
--background` step; remove any you find. If `mops.toml` has an
`[optimize]` section (it should, per Key Conventions — added in
Step 5 if missing), also install `wasm-opt` in CI via `mops
toolchain bin wasm-opt` before `mops bench`.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    name: Tests and Benchmarks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: latest
      - uses: caffeinelabs/setup-mops@v1
      - run: mops install --locked
      - run: mops test --locked   # Omit if no tests
      # Benchmarks: pocket-ic is the only bench runtime (mops CLI
      # v3.0.0 removed dfx-replica support). Requires [toolchain]
      # pocket-ic to be pinned in mops.toml. Omit both steps if there
      # are no benchmarks.
      - name: Make sure pocket-ic is installed
        run: mops toolchain bin pocket-ic
      # Only if mops.toml has an [optimize] section (see Key
      # Conventions / Step 5) — otherwise omit this step too.
      - name: Make sure wasm-opt is installed
        run: mops toolchain bin wasm-opt
      - run: mops bench --locked

  fmt:
    name: Formatting Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: latest
      - name: Prettier Check
        run: |
          npm install prettier prettier-plugin-motoko --no-save
          npx -y prettier --plugin prettier-plugin-motoko --check '**/*.{mo,json,md}'
```

Per Key Conventions, do **not** add a `moc --check` step to CI.

### Step 10 — Bump the version

Check the last published version first (`mops info <package>`): the
bump is relative to that, not to whatever `mops.toml` says. Don't
release a package whose changes since then aren't visible to
consumers (lockfile, CI, dev-dependencies only).

1. In root `mops.toml`, increment the version. Default = **patch**
   (`1.2.3` → `1.2.4`). Bump **minor** (and reset patch) if any of:
   - `[requirements] moc` was raised (consumers need a newer compiler);
   - a `[dependencies]` package crossed a major and this package
     re-exports types/functions from it;
   - source signatures or runtime semantics consumers might rely on
     changed.

   For `0.x.y`, shift the rule one segment right.

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "my-package"
   version = "1.2.4"   # was 1.2.3
   ```

2. Update the CHANGELOG `Unreleased` header to the new number:
   `## 1.2.4`.

3. Update self-dependency comments in every nested `mops.toml`
   (from Step 3a) to the new version:

   ```toml
   self-package-name = "../"
   # Replace with:
   # self-package-name = "1.2.4"
   ```

### Step 11 — Commit and push

**Audit untracked files first.** Compare `git status --short` against
`/tmp/baseline.txt` (Step 0). Files that predate your work
(`*.debug.bench.mo`, `roxy.txt`, ad-hoc experiments) are scratch —
leave unstaged, `.gitignore` them, or delete. Never `git add -A`
blindly. Ask the user if unsure.

Stage changes. If `package.json` / `package-lock.json` didn't exist
at the start but `npm install` created them, do **not** commit them.

```bash
git add -u
git add .gitignore CHANGELOG.md .prettierrc .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null || true
git add $(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | grep -E '(^|/)mops\.lock$')
git status
git commit -m "chore: bump dependencies and prepare v<NEW_VERSION>"
```

Inform the user:

```text
Branch: chore/dependency-bump-YYYY-MM-DD
Ready for review. Run `git push -u origin HEAD` to push.
```

### Step 12 — Check the publish (dry run)

For the full release procedure (PR, CodeRabbit review, publish, merge,
cleanup) follow the `motoko-mops-release` skill; this step covers the
dry run only.

```bash
mops publish --dry-run   # docs, tests and benchmarks, no registry contact
```

- **Benchmarks are run, uploaded and compared by file name.** `mops
  publish` benchmarks every `*.bench.mo` on disk, tracked or not: move
  scratch bench files out of `bench/` first, or they get published.
  mops.one compares each version's benchmarks with the previous
  version's *by file name*; after a methodology change (moc major, GC,
  persistence) renaming the bench files resets the baseline instead of
  showing large, misleading percentages. Zero values show as `-`.
- **mops CLI ≤ 3.4.2 + moc 2.0.0:** `mops publish` hard-codes the
  copying GC for its benchmark run and fails with
  `moc: unknown option '--legacy-persistence'` for any package with
  benchmarks (caffeinelabs/mops#875, fixed by #877). Until a release
  has the fix, publish with `--no-bench` (no benchmark upload) or
  with a CLI built from the fix.
- **Read the file list** the dry run prints. The default pattern
  `**/*.mo` also uploads `examples/**/*.mo`.
- **Identity:** `mops publish` signs with mops's own identity
  (`mops user get-principal`), not dfx's; it must be an owner or
  maintainer (`mops owner list`).
- **Node:** if a real publish fails with `TrustError: Certificate
  verification error` on Node 24, retry with Node 22.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Major-version dep bumps.** If a MOPS dep jumps a major
   (`1.x` → `2.x`), read its CHANGELOG — the API likely changed. Flag
   non-trivial migrations to the user.
2. **`[requirements] moc` exhaustive search.** Test EVERY intermediate
   version (Step 3); never skip. Prefer the lowest version that
   passes all checks, even below what `core` declares, to maximize
   consumer compatibility.
3. **Lock file drift.** Always run `mops install` after editing
   `mops.toml`. Never hand-edit `mops.lock`.
4. **CHANGELOG ordering.** Newest at the top.
5. **Benchmarking without `[optimize]`.** If a package has benchmarks
   but no `[optimize]` section, `mops bench` silently measures
   unoptimized Wasm (see Key Conventions / Step 5). Don't skip adding
   it just because `mops bench` "already works" without it — working
   and representative are different things.

6. **zsh word splitting.** In zsh, an unquoted `$args` is *not* split
   into words: `moc $(mops sources)` works, but `SRC=$(mops sources);
   moc $SRC` passes one argument and moc prints its usage. Use
   `${=SRC}`.

## Verify It Works

```bash
mops install --locked
mops test --locked
mops bench --locked
mops publish --dry-run
```

All must succeed with no errors.
