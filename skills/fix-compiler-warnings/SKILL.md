# Fixing Motoko Compiler Warnings

## How to Run the Build Check

### For DFX projects:

```bash
dfx build --check 2>&1 | tee /tmp/dfx_build_output.txt
```

This type-checks all canisters without deploying. Redirect stderr to capture warnings. The build takes several minutes for large projects.

### For MOPS packages:

```bash
find src -type f -name "*.mo" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 $(mops toolchain bin moc) --check $(mops sources) 2>&1 | tee /tmp/moc_check_output.txt
```

This uses `moc --check` on each file individually to avoid excessive warnings. It is often faster than a full `dfx build --check` and is ideal for standalone Motoko packages.

To count warnings by type:
```bash
grep -o 'M0[0-9]*' /tmp/dfx_build_output.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Warning Code Reference

### M0194 — Unused Identifier

**What it means:** A variable, parameter, import, or binding is declared but never used.

**How to fix:** Prefix the identifier with `_` (e.g., `caller` → `_caller`). For catch bindings, use plain `_` (e.g., `catch (e)` → `catch (_)`), never `_e`.

**CRITICAL PITFALLS:**

1. **Unused record fields in function parameter destructuring: remove the field entirely.** In Motoko, record types are structural and support width subtyping — a function that expects `{ response : ... }` will accept `{ context : Blob; response : ... }` because the caller's record has *more* fields than required. So the correct fix is to drop the unused field from the parameter record:

   ```motoko
   // ❌ WRONG — renaming the field changes the record type, causes M0096 type errors
   public query func transform({
     _context : Blob;
     response : { ... };
   }) : async { ... } { ... }

   // ❌ ALSO WRONG — leaving it triggers M0194 warning
   public query func transform({
     context : Blob;
     response : { ... };
   }) : async { ... } { ... }

   // ✅ CORRECT — remove the unused field; subtyping accepts the extra field from callers
   public query func transform({
     response : { ... };
   }) : async { ... } { ... }
   ```

   The IC runtime passes `{ context = <blob>; response = <http_response> }`. Because Motoko uses structural subtyping, a function expecting just `{ response : ... }` will accept records that also have a `context` field — the extra field is simply ignored.

   **Rule:** If M0194 fires on a record field in a function parameter, remove the field from the destructuring pattern. Do NOT rename it with `_` prefix.

2. **Word-boundary regex can rename method calls.** If a variable `liquidity` is unused on the same line as `poolActor.liquidity()`, a naive `\b` regex will rename both. Use a negative lookbehind/lookahead that excludes dots:
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG — also renames poolActor.liquidity()
   pattern = rf'\b{identifier}\b'

   # ✅ CORRECT — won't match after a dot
   pattern = rf'(?<![._a-zA-Z0-9]){re.escape(identifier)}(?![_a-zA-Z0-9])'
   ```

3. **Unused imports** are safe to prefix (e.g., `import Time "mo:base/Time"` → `import _Time "mo:base/Time"`), but consider just deleting the import instead if it's truly not needed.

**Safe categories to rename:**
- `catch (e)` → `catch (_)` (catch bindings — always use plain `_`, never `_e` or `_err`)
- `let foo = ...` → `let _foo = ...` (let bindings, only if truly unused)
- `func bar(caller : Principal)` → `func bar(_caller : Principal)` (function params that are simple names, NOT record fields)
- Unused record fields in function parameter destructuring → remove the field entirely (subtyping handles it)
- `import Foo "..."` → `import _Foo "..."` (unused imports, or just delete them)

**Catch block convention:** Always use `catch (_)` with a plain wildcard, not `catch (_e)` or `catch (_err)`. Since the error value is intentionally discarded, `_` communicates that clearly and doesn't create a named identifier.

**Bulk fix approach:** Extract all M0194 warnings from build output, parse file:line:identifier, apply fixes via Python script. Example:

```python
import re

def fix_m0194(filepath, line_num, identifier):
    """Prefix an unused identifier with _ on a specific line."""
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    line = lines[line_num - 1]  # 1-indexed
    # Careful regex: don't match after dots (method calls)
    pattern = rf'(?<![._a-zA-Z0-9]){re.escape(identifier)}(?![_a-zA-Z0-9])'
    new_line = re.sub(pattern, f'_{identifier}', line, count=1)
    lines[line_num - 1] = new_line

    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        f.writelines(lines)
```

### M0244 — Variable Could Be `let`

**What it means:** A `var` binding is never reassigned, so it could be `let` (immutable).

**How to fix:** Change `var` to `let`:
```motoko
// Before
var foo = computeSomething();
// After
let foo = computeSomething();
```

Also applies to `transient var` → `transient let` and `stable var` → `stable let` (though `stable let` has restrictions — only use if the value is a constant or initializer that doesn't need upgradeability).

**Bulk fix approach:** Parse warnings from build output (file:line:varname), then for each line replace `\bvar\b` with `let` (count=1). This is safe because the compiler has already verified the variable is never reassigned.

**Safe to bulk fix.** These are always safe to change unless the variable is intentionally left mutable for future use.

## General Strategy

**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT modify any code unless an explicit warning or error (Mxxxx) was produced by the compiler for that specific line and issue. Never apply "fixes" for perceived issues that the compiler does not actually complain about. For example, do NOT change dot-notation to module calls unless the compiler explicitly reports a warning or error on that line.

**IMPORTANT: Progress in stages.** Fix one type of error/warning at a time, then run tests/benchmarks again, before advancing to the next error type.

1. Run the build check (see above) and capture output.
2. Count warnings by code to prioritize.
3. Fix ONE warning type at a time (e.g., all M0194, then all M0244).
4. After each stage of fixes, always rebuild/recheck to verify no new errors were introduced.
5. Run tests and benchmarks to ensure no behavioral regressions.
6. Watch for **type errors (M0096)** after renaming — they indicate you broke a type signature
7. Record field renames in IC interface functions will cause cascading type errors

## Environment Notes

- Build time varies by repository size and number of canisters.
- If a repository has pre-existing build failures unrelated to compiler warnings, document them separately and avoid treating them as warning-fix regressions.
- Compiler warnings can vary by `moc` version, so record the active compiler version when it is relevant to reproducing or triaging results.
